<h1>A DEFENSE FOR <i>lon</i> AS YES (to anu seme)</h1>
<p>
  Many tokiponists say you can't use <i>lon</i> to answer 'anu seme' questions for many different reasons.
  I will answer all the criticisms I have seen.
</p>
<h2>1. Not all languages have an all-purpose "yes", so this is Englishy.</h2>
<p>
  It's true that not all languages have an all-purpose "yes". But this is only a "yes" for the "anu seme" type of
  question, not for all questions. This type of question can be answered with "lon", while "sina pona ala pona?" can be answered
  with "pona". 
</p>

<h2>2. It doesn't follow lipu pu.</h2>
<p>
  It's perfectly fine to follow lipu pu! However, some common grammar don't follow lipu pu, such as using <i>alasa</i> as a preverb, <i>kin</i> and <i>namako</i>
  with unique meanings, and using nimi ku suli. This is common enough to be one of those.
