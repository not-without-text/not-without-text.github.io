<h1>A DEFENSE FOR <i>lon</i> AS YES (to anu seme)</h1>
<p>
  Many tokiponists say you can't use <i>lon</i> to answer 'anu seme' questions for many different reasons.
  I will answer all the criticisms I have seen.

<h2>1. Not all languages have an all-purpose "yes", so this is Englishy.</h2>
<p>
  It's true that not all languages have an all-purpose "yes". But this is only a "yes" for the "anu seme" type of
  question, not for all questions. This type of question can be answered with "lon", while "sina pona ala pona?" can be answered
  with "pona".
